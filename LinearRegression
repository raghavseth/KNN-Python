#Importing data for supervised learning
This involves creating feature and target variable arrays. 
Furthermore, since you are going to use only one feature to begin with, you need to do some reshaping using NumPy's .reshape() method. 
Don't worry too much about this reshaping right now, but it is something you will have to do occasionally when working with scikit-learn so it is useful to practice.
# Import numpy and pandas
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Read the CSV file into a DataFrame: df
df = pd.read_csv('gapminder.csv')

# Create arrays for features and target variable
y = df.life.values
X = df['fertility'].values

# Print the dimensions of X and y before reshaping
print("Dimensions of y before reshaping: {}".format(y.shape))
print("Dimensions of X before reshaping: {}".format(X.shape))

# Reshape X and y
y = y.reshape(-1,1)
X = X.reshape(-1,1)

# Print the dimensions of X and y after reshaping
print("Dimensions of y after reshaping: {}".format(y.shape))
print("Dimensions of X after reshaping: {}".format(X.shape))
