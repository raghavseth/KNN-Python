Fit a lasso regression to the Gapminder data you have been working with and plot the coefficients. 
Just as with the Boston data, you will find that the coefficients of some features are shrunk to 0, with only the most important ones remaining.
# Import Lasso
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso

# Instantiate a lasso regressor: lasso
lasso = Lasso(alpha = 0.4, normalize = True)

# Fit the regressor to the data
lasso.fit(X, y)

# Compute and print the coefficients
lasso_coef = lasso.coef_
print(lasso_coef)

# Plot the coefficients
plt.plot(range(len(df_columns)), lasso_coef)
plt.xticks(range(len(df_columns)), df_columns.values, rotation=60)
plt.margins(0.02)
plt.show()
