Precision is how precise the model is i.e. out of all the predictions of an event being true or 1 , how many of them are actually true
Recall is the metric to identify that out of all the actual values of event being true or 1, how many was the model able to recall

# Import necessary modules
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

# Create training and test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.4, random_state=42)

# Instantiate a k-NN classifier: knn
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=6)

# Fit the classifier to the training data
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the labels of the test data: y_pred
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)

# Generate the confusion matrix and classification report
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
